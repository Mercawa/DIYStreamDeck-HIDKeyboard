# DIY Stream Deck – HID Keyboard

This is a completed DIY Stream Deck project based on an Arduino Pro Micro (ATmega32u4).

The project started from a 3D printed enclosure found on GitHub that relied on custom configuration software.  
Instead of using dedicated software, the firmware was redesigned so the device behaves as a standard USB HID keyboard.

Each button sends extended function keys (F13–F25), allowing direct and simple configuration inside third-party applications such as Discord, OBS, or any software that supports keyboard shortcuts.

## Features
- Native USB HID keyboard
- 12 physical buttons
- Extended function keys (F13–F24)
- Central RGB lighting (NeoPixel)
- Multiple lighting modes
- No external software required

## Hardware
- Arduino Pro Micro (ATmega32u4)
- Mechanical switches
- NeoPixel RGB LEDs
- 3D printed enclosure

## Status
✔ Project completed and fully functional.

## Notes
This project focuses on embedded systems and firmware development, prioritizing simplicity, reliability, and hardware-based solutions.
